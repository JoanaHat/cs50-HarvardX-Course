# About The Project
## Project Name: LambLight Report Sheet
## **[Video Link](https://youtu.be/WA6FCQt2Brg)**


Nurses need a brief summary of the overall health of all patients under them during a shift.
Many nurses choose to be casual nurses in more than one place, meeting 1 or more new patients on every shift.
Reading patient summaries in a short timeframe becomes a tedious task.
In a fast-paced and somewhat chaotic environment, a tool is needed to scan patient information in a timely manner.
Lamplight Report Sheet attempts to mitigate this problem by providing quick and summarized information for each patient.
Additionally, at the end of each shift, nurses need to chart all their observations and procedures done to all patients during a shift, this too can be very time-consuming.
The end of shift report on the app is almost completely prefilled to save time at the end of a shift.
