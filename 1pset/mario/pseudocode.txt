Creating a right-aligned pyramid next to a left-aligned pyramid, seperated by space

1. Get height of pyramid from user
2.      reprompt user until height is between 1 and 8, inclusive

3. Create a function that prints a given number of space 
4.      for n times
5.          print n spaces

6. Create a function that prints right-aligned rows
7.      for each row n where i = to number of # to print
8.          print (pyramid height - i) spaces 
9.          then print #, i times

10. Create a function that prints right-aligned rows
11.      for each row n where i = to number of # to print
12.         print #, i times

13. In the main function after getting the pyramid height 
14.     for each pyramid row (basically nested loops)
15.         call right-aligned function
16.         call space function
17.         call left-aligned function
