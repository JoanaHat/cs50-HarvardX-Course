Luhn's Algorithm

1. Get positive long credit card number

2. While credit card is not 0 
3.      Get last digit of credit card
4.      for every other digit starting with the second-to-last digit
5.          multipy the digit by 2 
6.          if the product is >= 10
7.              add 1 to the variable even
8.              add the remainder of the product/10 to even
9.          else if the product is < 10, add the product to even
10.     for every digit that does not satisfy point 4
11.         add the digit to the variable odd

12. Add the variable odd to even

13. If the sum is divisible by 10 
14.     If the 2nd digit is 1,2,3,4, or 5; the first digit is 5; and the lenght is 16
15.         print MASTERCARD
16.     If the 2nd digit is 4 or 7; the first digit is 3; and the length is 15
17.         print AMEX
18.     If the first digit 4; and the lenght is 13 or 16
20.         print VISA
21.     else print INVALID
22. If the sum is not divisible by 10 print INVALID
