Greedy Algorithm: return the Least amount of change 

1. Get positive change
2. multiply change by 100

3. If change is divisible by 25
4.      count = change/25
5.      if remainder of change/25 >= 10
6.          count = count + remainder/10
7.          if remainder/10 does not equal 0
8.              if remainder/10 >= 5
9.                  count  = count + remainder/5
10.                 if remainder/5 does not equal to 0
11.                     count = count + remainder
12.                         print count
13.     if remainder of change/25 >= 5
14.         repeat number 9 to 12
15.     if remainder of change/25 < 5
16.         repeat number 11 to 12
17. If change is divisible by 10
18.     repeat numbers 9 to 12
20. If change is divisible by 5
21.     repeat number 9 to 12
22. If change is < 5
23.     print change
